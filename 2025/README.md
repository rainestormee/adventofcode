Completely first experiences using Rust.

Seeing how I cope with AOC.


# Day 1 Notes:

Really? not int? i32? sure okay 

SO string is funky. so is slicing them.

.split() just eats the thing i use to split it with. okay fine. but for regex as well? aw there goes my plan to match [LR].

Arrays and vectors are very different. 

Stop making me fix my types to your weird ones.

|x| is fun syntax. why not.

MODULO IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. thanks stackoverflow for rem_euclid.

was originally a `Vec<Vec<str>>` thanks for tuples


# Day 2 Notes:

looks like a substring search feels like a substring search

OOPS I SOLVED PART 2 BEFORE PART 1 BECAUSE I MISREAD THE CHALLENGE INFO. OH WELL

Didn't realise part 1 wanted a ONCE copy not an N copy. 

Okay so the int naming convention actually makes a lot of sense.
