Completely first experiences using Rust.

Seeing how I cope with AOC.

Day 1 Notes:

Really? not int? i32? sure okay 
SO string is funky. so is slicing them.
.split() just eats the thing i use to split it with. okay fine. but for regex as well? aw there goes my plan to match [LR].
Arrays and vectors are very different. 
Stop making me fix my types to your weird ones.
|x| is fun syntax. why not.
MODULO IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. thanks stackoverflow for rem_euclid.

was originally a `Vec<Vec<str>>` thanks for tuples
